Reduced discharge model
====

This code implements a reduced discharge model in which the conductivity and the potential evolve in time.

Compilation
==

1. Compile the shared libraries in the `libs` folder
2. Type `make`

Running
==

1. TODO: Describe how to prepare the input files that serve as an initial condition
2. Run `first_model.py` using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs/lib python first_model.py` (otherwise the shared libraries are not found)
