Conducting cylinder discharge model
====

This code implements a reduced discharge model in which the conductivity and the potential evolve in time.


Getting the code and compiling for the first time
==

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jannisteunissen/reduced-discharge-model.git
    cd reduced-discharge-model
    make

Running
==

1. TODO: Describe how to prepare the input files that serve as an initial condition
2. Run `first_model.py` using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=libs/lib python first_model.py` (otherwise the shared libraries are not found)
